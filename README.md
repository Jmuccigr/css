# css
Some css files I currently use and have used in the past. Feel free.

* clean_notes.css: used for making lecture notes. Font's a little smaller, headings get underlined, and overall text is closer together.
* clean_para_numbering.css: article format with (manual) paragraph numbers in the left margin.
* clean_CV.css: used for CV. (Renamed from clean\_md.css.)
